VEwaningVariant v1.2 (Release date: 2022-01-17)
==============

Changes:

Allow for participant specific lag times. This change required that the
post-processing tools, ve() and plot(), be modified to refer to 
"time since full efficacy" rather the original "time since first dose".

Allow for user specified cutoff for including/excluding phases in the analysis.
